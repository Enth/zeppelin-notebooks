# Welcome to Enth
Enth is **n-dimensional awareness of data**.   Enth crawls networks, including private networks looking for data, structured, open, elastic, relational, text,.. Enth doesn’t ‘download’ this data, instead Enth **scans the data** as part of a machine learning process, in which Enth creates an **awareness of data**.  Enth uses this awareness of data to orchestrate the acquisition and transformation of data into **Spark**.  In other words, Enth tells Spark where to find specific data and what to do with it.

Enth-Spark-AI provides access to Enth.  This notebook contains information on installing Enth-Spark-AI into Apache Zeppelin, as well as provide some basic "How-To's" so you can quickly get going.  For more detailed information, please visit [Enth](http://www.enth.com).
